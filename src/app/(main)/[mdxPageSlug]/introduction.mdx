🌍 Hello! I'm Bhanu Prasad, a Full Stack Software Engineer from India 🇮🇳, currently working remotely for Realadvisor, a Swiss-based appraisal and property platform.

🏋️‍♂️ I'm passionate about fitness and constantly strive to be a better version of myself every day. I enjoy sharing this journey and connecting with others who are on similar paths.

🎬 In my downtime, I'm an avid movie buff, frequently binge-watching series like "The Big Bang Theory" and "Modern Family."
